Usage: Feel free to edit this program however you like!

Instructions: The only class that you need to run is NMR.java. The terminal will then prompt for an InChI key.
Some InChI codes do not work, but the one for Acetone does.

Bugs:
1. Some InChI codes do not retrieve an XML file from the server.
2. Some computers cannot support the resolution needed for the Java Graphics.
